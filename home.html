                History
                Falguni Nayar, a former managing director at Kotak Mahindra Capital Company, founded Nykaa in 2012. It was launched as an ecommerce portal curating a range of beauty and wellness products.[1][2] The brand name Nykaa is derived from the Sanskrit word nayaka, meaning ‘one in the spotlight’.[3]
                
                In 2015, the company expanded from online-only to an omnichannel model and began selling fashion products.[4][5]
                
                Funding
                Nykaa has raised money through multiple rounds of funding from the family office of Harsh Mariwala, Sunil Munjal and Zia Mody, TVS Shriram Growth Fund, Max Group and TPG Growth.[6][7][8] In March 2020, it raised INR 100 crore from Steadview Capital.[9]

It claims to have over 3 lakh products across 1,500 brands.[10][8]
                
                It has two offline store formats called Nykaa Luxe and Nykaa On Trend. The Luxe format features Indian and international luxury beauty brands along with Nykaa Beauty, the in-house collection of beauty products. The latter format has products curated by category basis their popularity.[11]

                Security and privacy issues
                On 18 November 2019, API flaw was detected in Nykaa Fashion’s internal systems that allowed a potential attacker to log in to any user account if the attacker had access to the user’s email ID. This could potentially put its users data at risk of being hijacked.[14][15] Consequently, the company fixed the security vulnerability.[14]
